# DatabaseSQL

This repository contains SQL scripts for practicing and learning **database operations** using MySQL.  
It includes examples of creating databases and tables, inserting and updating data, deleting records, altering tables, and performing joins.

## Project Overview

The main SQL script (`college_db.sql`) demonstrates the following:

- **Database and Table Creation**  
- **Inserting Data**  
- **Updating and Deleting Records**  
- **Altering Tables** (add, drop, rename columns)  
- **Aggregate Functions** (COUNT, GROUP BY)  
- **Joins**:
  - LEFT JOIN
  - RIGHT JOIN
  - FULL OUTER JOIN (using UNION)
- **Filtering** (WHERE clause)  
- **Ordering Results** (ORDER BY)

This script uses a **college scenario** with three tables:

1. **student** – stores student information (roll, name, marks, city, age, etc.)  
2. **dept** – stores department details (id, name)  
3. **teacher** – stores teacher details and links to departments
